              I work as a full-stack software engineer for BBC Archive Services.
              I am both interested in frontend and backend technologies. I
              really like building web-apps with React, games in Unity Engine
              and learning new programming languages and concepts. I am a bit of
              a data geek and I like reading about AI and Data Science.
              <br />
              <br />
              My interests are focused on impact of technology on people's
              everyday life and how technology can improve things.
              <br />
              <br />
              Outside that, I like learning about history of the world, write
              and read books, doing yoga (when I don't feel lazy), travel and
              cook. During lockdown I started an online book club in Edinburgh,
              and I joined few other book clubs as well.
